🚀 **Let’s collaborate and create something extraordinary!**  


- 🔭 I’m currently working on Computer Vision and Generative Adversarial Nets.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux, Explainable AI, Agentic AI, LLMs.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects combining Agentic Workflows with Multimodal Generative AI.
- 💬 Ask me about Linguistics, and best practices in Data Preprocessing and Visualization.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a music and linguistics hobbyist. I learn the piano and I'm fascinated by the theory of music.🎼
- I find that poetry, music and linguistics are not all that different from writing programs.
- Indeed, programming can be poetic- it has structure, meaning and nuance!
